            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>In a large skillet, cook and stir ground beef until brown. Add mushrooms, onion, garlic, and oregano; saute for 6 minutes. Pour in tomato sauce and tomato paste. Simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add lasagna noodles, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente; drain.</li>
                <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
                <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
                <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.
